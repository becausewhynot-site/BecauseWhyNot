Well What do you plan on doing on this grand adventure? Well get to reading the idea

# grand adventure
This idea for a grand adventure came from a drunken stuper and i am pretty lit still so bare with me.

Imagine you are a new runescape player and its the year 2006 (why no idea), You login to the main game and find that the normal runescape was hard but you wanted something fun but still decent to play. Well you end up playing PimpScape, hellzend, Allstarscape, CheezeScape, CheatSakape, TomScape, Silab Servers and the list goes on the point is i wanted to create something insane from my past servers.

Boom the sever no one wanted and i just heard bet! They asked why ? Because why not!
